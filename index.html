<h3>Current Gig: Data Ops Engineer at Blueskeye AI</h3>
<p>I started at Blueskeye AI as a <em>Junior Data Ops Engineer</em>, but within three months they realised I was too brilliant for the &quot;Junior&quot; tag and ditched it.</p>
<p>I overhauled our inefficient <strong>web-based annotation platform</strong>, using <strong>NiceGUI</strong> to build a <strong>sleek, modular system</strong> for creating annotation tools. I also migrated our annotation database from <strong>Firestore NoSQL</strong> to <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, designing and deploying a scalable, maintainable database and integrating <strong>long-term data warehousing</strong> for annotation storage.</p>
<p>I process so much <strong>video data</strong> that I dream about FFmpeg. I've automated away all the boring crap with a bespoke <strong>Python library</strong> to make life easier for everyone (read: <em>me</em>).</p>

</section>
<section class="work">
<h3>Side Gig: Teaching Assistant at Le Wagon</h3>
<p>I teach bootcamp students the ins and outs of <strong>Data Science</strong>. I teach a range of abilities, from those who thought Python was just a snake, right through to those who are deploying real-world projects.</p>
<p>I work <strong>one on one</strong> with students to help them understand tricky concepts, debug their code, and guide them through their projects. Sometimes I even learn new things myself.</p>
<p>The bootcamp covers everything from <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong>, to <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>Data Visualisation</strong>, and even a bit of <strong>MLOps</strong>.</p>

</section>
<section class="work">
<h3>Past Gig: Game Development Team Lead at Date & Game</h3>
<p>Created and maintained an <strong>online multiplayer framework</strong> for integration with a dating app, with fancy features such as world state synchronisation, <strong>race condition handling</strong>, and <strong>arbitrary resynchronisation</strong>.</p>
<p>Collaborated with our backend team, pixel artist, and game designer to create memorable experiences for our users.</p>
<p><strong>Trained up new recruits</strong> and managed our team's workflow.</p>

<h3>Past Gig: Head Brewer at Matlock Worlds Farm Brewery</h3>
<p>Before I became a data wizard, I was a <strong>beer wizard</strong>. I juggled with our brewing schedule, stock levels, and quality control.</p>
<p>I even designed two <strong>award-winning beers</strong> along the way, including <strong>Reverence</strong>, brewed with <strong>Victorian heritage barley Chevallier</strong>. It's as fancy as it sounds, ask me about it.</p>
<p>Even though I was a brewer, I still managed to squeeze in a little <strong>VBA</strong> coding to fill in spreadsheets for me.</p>

<h3>Student Feedback From Le Wagon</h3>
<ul>
<li>Looking for a smart, loving and helpful Nerd to fall in love with? It's Edward.</li>
<li>So happy to help always, always sending more resources so we could learn more, thank you so much.</li>
<li>Very creative and helpful, and super responsive. Great problem-solving skills, and on top of every topic.</li>
<li>Edward did his best to help me with my learning struggles and was very supportive. He's one of the TAs that made a difference during the difficult times.</li>
<li>Edward has an eagle eye for coding mistakes. Truly impressive. I can't think of a single time where he did not come up with an idea to help find a solution. Even for Docker (that means something, right :-)?) Thanks Ed!</li>
<li>Edward is great! He's so smart and has so many great tips. It was nice that he recently completed the BootCamp because he had a fresh perspective on what the students were going through.</li>
<li>OMG, Ed, I'll miss him. I can say easly he is the real full-stack person, a swiss knife. He knows about everything related to architechture, data engineetring, coding....and his extra plus, he is super humble.</li>

<h3>Coding Heaven: A Comedy Coding Blog</h3>
<p>Fed up of <strong>drab coding blogs</strong>? Me too. That's why I created <a target="_blank" href="https://edwardatkin.co.uk/?collection=coding_heaven"><strong>Coding Heaven</strong></a> - a blog that finds joy in coding.</p>
<p>I've tackled <strong>absurdities</strong> such as <a target="_blank" href="https://edwardatkin.co.uk/blog/operation_solution_steal"><strong>automated stealing of Advent of Code solutions</strong></a>, determining if a number is odd or even in <a target="_blank" href="https://edwardatkin.co.uk/blog/odd_or_even"><strong>Brainfuck</strong></a>, turning <a target="_blank" href="https://edwardatkin.co.uk/blog/fizz_buzz"><strong>Fizz Buzz</strong></a> into something that sounds <strong>sort of like music</strong>, and creating the universal <a target="_blank" href="https://edwardatkin.co.uk/blog/hello_world"><strong>'Hello, World!'</strong></a> equation.</p>
<p>It's coding, but <strong>fun</strong>.</p>

<h3>Blueskeye Annotation Tooling Suite (BATS)</h3>
<p>When I began work at Blueskeye, I inherited a web-based annotation tool. It was like a <strong>car with square wheels</strong> (it didn't work very well).</p>
<p>I rebuilt it using <strong>clean, reusable classes</strong> and <strong>smart inheritance</strong>. The result is a <strong>bespoke, extensible annotation suite</strong> that supports a massive range of tools, lets us deploy new features in <strong>hours (not weeks)</strong>, and handles <strong>hundreds of thousands of annotations</strong> (and no square wheels!).</p>
<p>Data retrieval times have been <strong>reduced</strong> and refactored to allow videos of any length and filesize to be annotated, removing bottlenecks for files over <strong>10MB</strong>.</p>

</section>
<section class="projects">
<h3>Data Processing Python Library</h3>
<p>At work I wrangle <strong>video data</strong>. One hell of a lot of video data. After rewriting the same code for the billionth time, I decided to write a <strong>Python library</strong> to do it for me. Every function and feature in the library was built and tested using <strong>test-driven development (TDD)</strong>, because breaking things is best avoided when dealing with <strong>terabytes of data</strong>.</p>
<p>The result is a library that <strong>simplified complex data processing tasks</strong> down to a mere few lines of code, integrates seamlessly with our annotation data warehouse, and can even be <strong>automated</strong> to continually process data whilst I sleep.</p>
<p>Errors have been <strong>reduced</strong> by standardising the processing pipelines and adding features such as <strong>auto-rotation</strong> to detect the orientation of videos, resulting in a reduction of both processing time and time lost to mistakes.</p>
<p><em>Laziness truly is the mother of invention</em>.</p>

<h3>Sokobanvania (Working Title)</h3>
<p>Ever played <a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.bitbusters.club/Main_Page"><strong>Chip's Challenge</strong></a>? Ever thought <em>&quot;what if this game were an open-world metroidvana? Someone should make that&quot;</em>? Yeah, me too.</p>
<p>Welcome to <strong>Sokobanvania</strong> - a seamless, dynamically loaded open-world puzzle game that mashes up <strong>block pushing</strong> with <strong>exploration</strong>.</p>
<p>Features include an <strong>undo system</strong> (sounds lame, actually really difficult to implement) and <strong>childlike coloured pencil artwork</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Codewars Obsessive</strong>: In the top <strong>0.5%</strong> of all <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codewars.com"><strong>Codewars</strong></a> users, I'm coming for you <strong>top 0.1%</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Built a CPU (virtually)</strong>: Followed a <strong>Udemy course</strong> covering the design and implementation of a <strong>CPU</strong> using logic gates. Now I sort of know how my computer works.</li>
<li><strong>Actually Used a Binary Search Algorithm</strong>: I once used a <strong>binary search algorithm</strong> to have files annotated in order of intensity.</li>
<li><strong>Actually Used Assembly Once</strong>: An Advent of Code challenge asked for a custom assembly language interpreter. I wrote it in <strong>x64 Assembly</strong>, thus completely missing the point of the challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Barely Profitable Gambler</strong>: I made a <a target="_blank" href="https://horseracing.edwardatkin.co.uk"><strong>horse racing predictor</strong></a>. Handled the entire pipeline from <strong>data sourcing</strong>, <strong>processing</strong>, and <strong>feature engineering</strong> right through to <strong>model training</strong>, <strong>deployment</strong>, <strong>automated prediction</strong>, results <strong>data warehousing</strong> and creating a <strong>robo-gambler</strong> using the <strong>Betfair API</strong> and a <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>. Boom - <strong>£1.88</strong> profit in its first year, truly living the dream (Don't quit your day job).</li>
<li><strong>Super Hexagon Perseverer</strong>: I beat Super Hexagon on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2gz6Wsr6PU"><strong>hardestestest difficulty (Hyper Hexagonest)</strong></a>, seriously, it was a proud moment.</li>
<li><strong>Rollerblading Juggling Extraordinaire</strong>: I used to <strong>rollerblade</strong> regularly, then I broke my hip (totally unrelated, I was on quad skates). I learnt to juggle to fill the void in my heart. I haven't tried to combine the two... yet.</li>
<li><strong>Crash Bandicoot, One-Handed Victory</strong>: I beat the original <strong>Crash Bandicoot</strong> on PS1 using only my left hand. I'd played the game about a million times, I had to jazz it up somehow.</li>
<li><strong>Pet Cat Wrangler</strong>: I have two cats, they don't respect my keyboard, they're also the reason I can't have nice things. Somehow I still love them.</li>
<li><strong>Vim and Shell Enthusiast</strong>: I use <strong>Vim</strong> btw. It took a year before it was faster than a regular text editor. Worth it? Maybe. Sunk cost fallacy? Definitely. <code>:w</code></li>
<li><strong>Speed Typist</strong>: I once typed at <strong>160WPM</strong> for 15 seconds. If you ever need someone to type something like <code>SELECT * FROM useless_skills</code> in 1 second, I'm your guy.</li>
