    <h2>Work</h2><h3>Current Gig: Data Ops Engineer at Blueskeye AI</h3><p>At Blueskeye AI I began as a mere Junior before being stripped of the Junior label after three months.</p>
<p>I overhauled our inefficient annotation platform, building a <strong>robust modular system</strong> for creating annotation tools and migrating our annotation database from <strong>Firestore NoSQL</strong> to <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>. I designed and deployed a scalable, maintainable database and built a <strong>long-term data warehousing solution</strong> for annotation storage.</p>
<p>I've also processed a hell of a lot of <strong>video data</strong> and automated away all the boring crap with a bespoke <strong>Python library</strong> to make life easier for everyone.</p>
<h3>Side Gig: Teaching Assistant at Le Wagon</h3><p>I teach bootcamp students the ins and outs of <strong>Data Science</strong>. I teach a range of abilities, from those who thought Python was just a snake, right through to those who are deploying real-world projects.</p>
<p>I work <strong>one on one</strong> with students to help them understand the material, debug their code, and guide them through their projects.</p>
<p>The bootcamp covers a wide range of topics including <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, <strong>Data Visualisation</strong>, and <strong>MLOps</strong>.</p>
<h3>Past Gig: Game Development Team Lead at Date & Game</h3><p>Created and maintained an <strong>online multiplayer framework</strong> for integration with a dating app, with fancy features such as world state synchronisation, <strong>race condition handling</strong>, and <strong>arbitrary resynchronisation</strong>.</p>
<p>Collaborated with our backend team, pixel artist, and game designer to create memorable experiences for our users.</p>
<p><strong>Trained up new recruits</strong> and managed our team's workflow.</p>
<h3>Past Gig: Head Brewer at Matlock Worlds Farm Brewery</h3><p>Before I was a data wizard, I was a <strong>beer wizard</strong>. I managed our brewing schedule, stock levels, and quality control.</p>
<p>Designed two <strong>award-winning beers</strong> along the way, including one with <strong>Victorian heritage barley Chevallier</strong> (pretty cool, ask me about it).</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2><h3>Coding Heaven: A Comedy Coding Blog</h3><p>Fed up of <em>drab coding blogs</em>? Me too. That's why I created <a href="https://edwardatkin.co.uk/?collection=coding_heaven"><strong>Coding Heaven</strong></a> - a blog that finds joy in coding.</p>
<p>I've tackled absurdities such as <a href="https://edwardatkin.co.uk/blog/operation_solution_steal"><strong>automated stealing of Advent of Code solutions</strong></a>, determining if a number is odd or even in <a href="https://edwardatkin.co.uk/blog/odd_or_even"><strong>Brainfuck</strong></a>, turning <a href="https://edwardatkin.co.uk/blog/fizz_buzz"><strong>Fizz Buzz</strong></a> into something that sounds sort of like music, and creating the universal <a href="https://edwardatkin.co.uk/blog/hello_world"><strong>'Hello, World!'</strong></a> equation.</p>
<p>It's coding, but <strong>fun</strong>.</p>
<h3>Blueskeye Annotation Tooling Suite (BATS)</h3><p>When I began work at Blueskeye, I inherited a web-based annotation tool. It was like a <strong>car with square wheels</strong> (it didn't work very well).</p>
<p>I rebuilt it using <strong>clean, reusable classes</strong> and <strong>smart inheritance</strong>. The result is a <strong>bespoke, extensible annotation suite</strong> that supports a massive range of tools, lets us deploy new features in <strong>hours (not weeks)</strong>, and handles <strong>hundreds of thousands of annotations</strong> (and no square wheels!).</p>
<p>Data retrieval times have been <strong>reduced</strong> and refactored to allow videos of any length and filesize to be annotated, removing bottlenecks for files over <strong>10MB</strong>.</p>
<h3>Data Processing Python Library</h3><p>At work I wrangle <strong>video data</strong>. One hell of a lot of video data. After rewriting the same code for the billionth time, I decided to write a <strong>Python library</strong> to do it for me. Every function and feature in the library was built and tested using <strong>test-driven development (TDD)</strong>, because breaking things is best avoided when dealing with <strong>terabytes of data</strong>.</p>
<p>The result is a library that <strong>simplified complex data processing tasks</strong> down to a mere few lines of code, integrates seamlessly with our annotation data warehouse, and can even be <strong>automated</strong> to continually process data whilst I sleep.</p>
<p>Errors have been <strong>reduced</strong> by standardising the processing pipelines and with the addition of features such as <strong>auto-rotation</strong> to detect the orientation of videos, resulting in a reduction of both processing time and time lost to mistakes.</p>
<p><em>Laziness truly is the mother of invention</em>.</p>
<h3>Sokobanvania (Working Title)</h3><p>Ever played <strong>Chip's Challenge</strong>? Ever thought <em>&quot;what if this game were an open-world metroidvana? Someone should make that&quot;</em>? Yeah, me too.</p>
<p>Welcome to <strong>Sokobanvania</strong> - a seamless, dynamically loaded open-world puzzle game that mashes up <strong>block pushing</strong> with <strong>exploration</strong>.</p>
<p>Features include an <strong>undo system</strong> (sounds lame, actually really difficult to implement) and <strong>childlike coloured pencil artwork</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Bonus Section</h2><p><p><strong>Codewars Obsessive</strong>: In the top <strong>0.5%</strong> of all <a href="https://www.codewars.com"><strong>Codewars</strong></a> users, I'm coming for you <strong>top 0.1%</strong>.</p>
</p><p><p><strong>Built a CPU (virtually)</strong>: Followed a <strong>Udemy course</strong> covering the design and implementation of a <strong>CPU</strong> using logic gates. Now I sort of know how my computer works.</p>
</p><p><p><strong>Super Hexagon Perseverer</strong>: I beat it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2gz6Wsr6PU"><strong>hardestestest difficulty (Hyper Hexagonest)</strong></a>, seriously, it was a proud moment.</p>
</p><p><p><strong>Rollerblading Juggling Extraordinaire</strong>: I used to <strong>rollerblade</strong> regularly, then I broke my hip (totally unrelated, I was on quad skates). I learnt to juggle to fill the void in my heart. I haven't tried to combine the two... yet.</p>
</p><p><p><strong>Crash Bandicoot, One-Handed Victory</strong>: I beat the original <strong>Crash Bandicoot</strong> on PS1 using only my left hand. I'd played the game about a million times, I had to jazz it up somehow.</p>
</p><p><p><strong>Barely Profitable Gambler</strong>: I made a <a href="https://horseracing.edwardatkin.co.uk"><strong>horse racing predictor</strong></a>. Handled the entire pipeline from <strong>data sourcing</strong>, <strong>processing</strong>, and <strong>feature engineering</strong> right through to <strong>model training</strong>, <strong>deployment</strong>, <strong>automated prediction and results data warehousing</strong> and creating a robo-gambler using the <strong>Betfair API</strong>. Boom - <strong>£1.88</strong> profit in its first year, truly living the dream (Don't quit your day job).</p>
</p><p><p><strong>Pet Cat Wrangler</strong>: I have two cats, they don't respect my keyboard, they're also the reason I can't have nice things. Somehow I still love them.</p>
</p><p><p><strong>Vim and Shell Enthusiast</strong>: I use <strong>Vim</strong> btw. It took a year before it was faster than a regular text editor. Worth it? Maybe. Sunk cost fallacy? Definitely. <code>:w</code></p>
</p><p><p><strong>Speed Typist</strong>: I once typed at <strong>160WPM</strong> for 15 seconds. If you ever need someone to type something like <code>SELECT * FROM useless_skills</code> in 1 second, I'm your guy.</p>
