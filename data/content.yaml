  sections:
    - name: ""
      content: |
        I'm a **Python** and **SQL** wizard who dabbles in JavaScript, C++, HTML/CSS and Game Devlopment.

        When I'm not coding, I'm **rollerblading**, **juggling**, or **petting my cats**.

        My gigs past and present include **data ops** engineering, **game dev** team leading, **teaching** data science and even **brewing** beer. Once I was a barman. I've pretty much done it all.

    - name: "Current Gig: Data Ops Engineer at Blueskeye AI"
      content: |
        I started at Blueskeye AI as a *Junior Data Ops Engineer*, but within three months they realised I was too brilliant for the "Junior" tag and ditched it.

        I overhauled our inefficient **web-based annotation platform**, using **NiceGUI** to build a **sleek, modular system** for creating annotation tools. I also migrated our annotation database from **Firestore NoSQL** to **PostgreSQL**, designing and deploying a scalable, maintainable database and integrating **long-term data warehousing** for annotation storage.

        I process so much **video data** that I dream about FFmpeg. I've automated away all the boring crap with a bespoke **Python library** to make life easier for everyone (read: *me*).
    - name: "Side Gig: Teaching Assistant at Le Wagon"
      content: |
        I teach bootcamp students the ins and outs of **Data Science**. I teach a range of abilities, from those who thought Python was just a snake, right through to those who are deploying real-world projects.

        I work **one on one** with students to help them understand tricky concepts, debug their code, and guide them through their projects. Sometimes I even learn new things myself.

        The bootcamp covers everything from **Python** and **SQL**, to **Machine Learning** and **Data Visualisation**, and even a bit of **MLOps**.
    - name: "Past Gig: Game Development Team Lead at Date & Game"
      content: |
        Created and maintained an **online multiplayer framework** for integration with a dating app, with fancy features such as world state synchronisation, **race condition handling**, and **arbitrary resynchronisation**.

        Collaborated with our backend team, pixel artist, and game designer to create memorable experiences for our users.

        **Trained up new recruits** and managed our team's workflow.

      content: |
        Before I became a data wizard, I was a **beer wizard**. I juggled with our brewing schedule, stock levels, and quality control.

        I even designed two **award-winning beers** along the way, including **Reverence**, brewed with **Victorian heritage barley Chevallier**. It's as fancy as it sounds, ask me about it.

        Even though I was a brewer, I still managed to squeeze in a little **VBA** coding to fill in spreadsheets for me.

        Fed up of **drab coding blogs**? Me too. That's why I created [**Coding Heaven**](https://edwardatkin.co.uk/?collection=coding_heaven) - a blog that finds joy in coding.

        I've tackled **absurdities** such as [**automated stealing of Advent of Code solutions**](https://edwardatkin.co.uk/blog/operation_solution_steal), determining if a number is odd or even in [**Brainfuck**](https://edwardatkin.co.uk/blog/odd_or_even), turning [**Fizz Buzz**](https://edwardatkin.co.uk/blog/fizz_buzz) into something that sounds **sort of like music**, and creating the universal [**'Hello, World!'**](https://edwardatkin.co.uk/blog/hello_world) equation.

        It's coding, but **fun**.

    - name: "Blueskeye Annotation Tooling Suite (BATS)"
      content: |
        When I began work at Blueskeye, I inherited a web-based annotation tool. It was like a **car with square wheels** (it didn't work very well).

        I rebuilt it using **clean, reusable classes** and **smart inheritance**. The result is a **bespoke, extensible annotation suite** that supports a massive range of tools, lets us deploy new features in **hours (not weeks)**, and handles **hundreds of thousands of annotations** (and no square wheels!).

        Data retrieval times have been **reduced** and refactored to allow videos of any length and filesize to be annotated, removing bottlenecks for files over **10MB**.
    - name: "Data Processing Python Library"
      content: |
        At work I wrangle **video data**. One hell of a lot of video data. After rewriting the same code for the billionth time, I decided to write a **Python library** to do it for me. Every function and feature in the library was built and tested using **test-driven development (TDD)**, because breaking things is best avoided when dealing with **terabytes of data**.

        The result is a library that **simplified complex data processing tasks** down to a mere few lines of code, integrates seamlessly with our annotation data warehouse, and can even be **automated** to continually process data whilst I sleep.

        Errors have been **reduced** by standardising the processing pipelines and adding features such as **auto-rotation** to detect the orientation of videos, resulting in a reduction of both processing time and time lost to mistakes.

        *Laziness truly is the mother of invention*.

        Ever played [**Chip's Challenge**](https://wiki.bitbusters.club/Main_Page)? Ever thought *"what if this game were an open-world metroidvana? Someone should make that"*? Yeah, me too.

        Welcome to **Sokobanvania** - a seamless, dynamically loaded open-world puzzle game that mashes up **block pushing** with **exploration**.

        Features include an **undo system** (sounds lame, actually really difficult to implement) and **childlike coloured pencil artwork**.

        - **Codewars Obsessive**: In the top **0.5%** of all [**Codewars**](https://www.codewars.com) users, I'm coming for you **top 0.1%**.
        - **Built a CPU (virtually)**: Followed a **Udemy course** covering the design and implementation of a **CPU** using logic gates. Now I sort of know how my computer works.
        - **Actually Used a Binary Search Algorithm**: I once used a **binary search algorithm** to have files annotated in order of intensity.
        - **Created an Assembly Interpreter in Assembly**: An Advent of Code challenge asked for a custom assembly language interpreter. I wrote it in **x64 Assembly**. So it wasn't really an interpreter at all. But it **did work**.
        - **Barely Profitable Gambler**: I made a [**horse racing predictor**](https://horseracing.edwardatkin.co.uk). Handled the entire pipeline from **data sourcing**, **processing**, and **feature engineering** right through to **model training**, **deployment**, **automated prediction**, results **data warehousing** and creating a **robo-gambler** using the **Betfair API** and a **Raspberry Pi**. Boom - **£1.88** profit in its first year, truly living the dream (Don't quit your day job).
        - **Super Hexagon Perseverer**: I beat Super Hexagon on [**hardestestest difficulty (Hyper Hexagonest)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2gz6Wsr6PU), seriously, it was a proud moment.
        - **Rollerblading Juggling Extraordinaire**: I used to **rollerblade** regularly, then I broke my hip (totally unrelated, I was on quad skates). I learnt to juggle to fill the void in my heart. I haven't tried to combine the two... yet.
        - **Crash Bandicoot, One-Handed Victory**: I beat the original **Crash Bandicoot** on PS1 using only my left hand. I'd played the game about a million times, I had to jazz it up somehow.
        - **Pet Cat Wrangler**: I have two cats, they don't respect my keyboard, they're also the reason I can't have nice things. Somehow I still love them.
        - **Vim and Shell Enthusiast**: I use **Vim** btw. It took a year before it was faster than a regular text editor. Worth it? Maybe. Sunk cost fallacy? Definitely. `:w`
        - **Speed Typist**: I once typed at **160WPM** for 15 seconds. If you ever need someone to type something like `SELECT * FROM useless_skills` in 1 second, I'm your guy.
