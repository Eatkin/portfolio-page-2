I overhauled our inefficient annotation platform, building a robust modular system for creating annotation tools and migrating our annotation database from Firestore NoSQL to PostgreSQL. I designed and deployed a scalable, maintainable database and built a long term data warehousing solution for annotation storage. I've also processed a hell of a lot of video data and automated away all the boring crap with a bespoke Python library to make life easier for everyone."

      "content": "When I began work at Blueskeye I inherited a web-based annotation tool. It was like a car with square wheels (it did't work very well). I rebuilt it using clean, reusable classes and smart inheritence. The result is a bespoke, extensible annotation suite that supports a massive range of tools, let's us deploy new features in hours (not weeks) and handles hundreds of thousands of annotations (and no square wheels!). Data retrieval times have been reduced and refactored to allow videos of any length and filesize to be annotated, removing bottlenecks for files over 10mb."

      "content": "At work I wrangle video data. One hell of a lot of video data. After rewriting the same code for the billionth time, I decided to write a Python library to do it for me. Every function and feature in the library was built and tested using test-driven development (TDD), because breaking things is best avoided when dealing with terabytes of data. The result is a library that simplified complex data processing tasks down to a mere few lines of code, integrates seamlessly with our annotation data warehouse and can even be automated to continually process data whilst I sleep. Errors have been reduced by standardising the processing pipelines and with the addition of features such as auto-rotation to detect the way-upness of videos, resulting in a reduction of both processing time and time lost to mistakes. Laziness truly is the mother of invention."
